## Aircall - About

Aircall is a minimalistic call history app created with ReactJS and axios.
Aircall is multi-tab and performs GET/POST request to an API to render/update call details.

## Aircall - Features
Aircall users can view a call history through 4 filtered categories:
- All Calls
- Inbox (Inbound calls)
- Outbox (Outbound calls)
- Archived (Archived calls)

Users are also able to archive any call in the first three categories - they are also able to navigate to the archived section and unarchive any previously archived call. Each call has an icon corresponding to its call type - inbound, outbound, missed, voicemail.

The aesthetic of this app is based around a minimalistic, text-focused black and white design. I was styling the app's components for positioning and layout and realized that I actually liked the simple monochrome look of the main call history page!
